<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to
your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables
the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture
and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us

for more information.</p>

<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>

<h2 id="california-online-privacy-protection-act">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p><strong>CalOPPA</strong> is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond
California to require any person or company in the United States (and
conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally
Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

<p>See more at:
<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>

<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>

<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>

<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page
or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on
the page specified above.</p>

<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
</ul>

<p>Can change your personal information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By emailing us</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>

<p>We don’t honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don’t
honor them because:
knowing what pages are active is fundamental for our blog to succeed. But this
feature is taken into consideration and may be implemented in the next few
months.</p>

<p>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
It’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

<h2 id="coppa-children-online-privacy-protection-act">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the
age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer
protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

<h2 id="fair-information-practices">Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in
the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role
in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the
Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
information.</p>

<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
  <li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days</li>
</ul>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h3 id="can-spam-act">CAN SPAM Act</h3>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or
questions</li>
  <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients
after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
  <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
  <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
  <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is
used.</li>
