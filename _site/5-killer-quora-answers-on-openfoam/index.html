    <p>There are <strong>1.3K</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">OpenFOAM</code> topic followers on Quora out of a total of <strong>23.1K</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">CFD</code> 
topic followers. I know this is probably not an accurate way to estimate how
many Quora users use OpenFOAM for their CFD simulation, but, at least, it gives a rough
estimate of how many Quora users are watching for OpenFOAM-related questions.

</ul>

<p>Personally, I wasn’t watching them until the moment I decided to summarize
interesting answers about OpenFOAM in this blog post.</p>

<p>So, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="will-i-learn-cfd-better-using-openfoam-as-compared-to-ansys-cfd">Will I learn CFD better using OpenFOAM as compared to Ansys CFD?</h2>

<p>When a user asked this question, he was, apparently, looking for an advice on how
to learn <strong>Computational Fluid Dynamics</strong>, and what piece of software should he
use to learn it.</p>

<p>Answers seem to emphasize on the fact that <strong>OpenFOAM</strong> is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Open Source</code>
software which makes learning <strong>CFD</strong> easier.</p>

<p>Going down the <strong>OpenFOAM</strong> road has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Makes people learn all sorts of things: Numerical analysis, C++ (even Python in my case) coding,
and the physics of things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a welcoming community which will help out if needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allows (and encourages) you to <strong>read</strong> the “source code” of all libraries, solvers and
utilities!! Actually, this a big help even if you don’t understand C++ at
all!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If one chooses to work with Commercial Software, he will benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Their GUI, probably; If he is a GUI person (Windows users mostly).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrated <code class="highlighter-rouge">Optimization</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Parameterization</code> facilities (In OpenFOAM case, we
usually use <strong>DAKOTA</strong> for this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dedicated support (hopefully).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learning curve (The software’s learning curve) is often shorter that
OpenFOAM’s.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to see what’s actually going on behind the scenes has always been a
big plus for open source software.</p>

<h2 id="does-openfoam-come-with-an-integrated-gui">Does OpenFOAM come with an integrated GUI?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply put: The answer is “there is no official graphical user interface for
OpenFOAM!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t get why people keep fixating on that! There is little need to a GUI, so
official releases don’t include one.</p>

<p>In addition, most OpenFOAM users run a great deal of their simulations in Ubuntu servers, thus
they will be interacting with the command line the whole time anyway.</p>

<p>The answers for this question feature some useful (for absolute beginners) GUI
applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sim-flow.com">SimFlow</a>: A really good GUI application which uses
standard OpenFAOM solvers and utilities to solve basic CFD problems. It allows
the integration of custom solvers but sets a low limit on <code class="highlighter-rouge">mesh cell count</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://simscale.com">SimScale</a>: A platform integrating OpenFOAM solvers and
providing free online CFD projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But I find it a bit weird that no one mentioned the very useful <a href="https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/GUI">wiki page</a>
which holds all major open source, free and commercial GUIs built for OpenFAOM (Even the
text-based one: <strong>pyFoam</strong>)</p>

<h2 id="does-it-matter-what-version-of-openfoam-you-use">Does it matter what version of OpenFOAM you use?</h2>

<p>OpenFOAM versions and forks can easily confuse new comers: I mean there are many versions for official
releases, extend project releases, OpenFOAM for Windows … and the list goes
on. So, It may be quite difficult for a new Open-Source software  follower to
distinguish between their features.</p>

<p>Answers on Quora on this question claim, and I agree with them, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are just starting to learn OpenFOAM, it doesn’t really matter which
version you use as long as it’s a not-so-old version. You are one release
behind? that’s OK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to solve a specific problem, It’s good to have both the newest
stable official version along side a <code class="highlighter-rouge">foam-extend</code> fork; It has many community
additions that may be of some use in your case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think It’s worth mentioning that OpenFOAM I/O (Input Output) format has
changed only once in 20 years, so, this probably something you shouldn’t worry
about (especially if you are a beginner who uses newer versions only).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choosing an OpenFOAM fork to work with is really a matter of preference; just
get the latest stable version of that fork!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="openfoam-users-what-is-the-biggest-bottleneck-in-using-it-cad-to-meshing-solver-parallel-performance-scalability-or-post-processing">OpenFOAM users, what is the biggest bottleneck in using it? CAD to meshing, solver, parallel performance (scalability), or post-processing?</h2>

<p>Let’s first present some user feedback for this question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CAD to OpenFOAM Mesh (people were using ~OF2 at that time) is considered painful.</li>
  <li>PISO and PIMPLE based solvers are hard to follow up (harder than basic ones at
least) because things are done implicitly!</li>
  <li>Post-processing tools are good (Talking about <strong>ParaView</strong> here, I think).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some users also report the lack of a GUI as an inconvenience, but this is their
opinion; Personally I think that:</p>

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<ul>
  <li>Meshing is no longer an issue: <code class="highlighter-rouge">snappyHexMesh</code> and the great <code class="highlighter-rouge">cfMesh</code> are up
for the task now (see my <a href="/openfoam-utilities-roundup-first/">OpenFOAM Utilities Roundup
1</a> if you want
to know more).</li>
  <li>Native post-processing is getting better with every release!</li>
  <li>The learning curve is steep: That’s what most people should focus on. May be
using a GUI first can help with this problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>You really need to take a look at the “Utilities Roundup” post; It has
interesting tricks that might be helpful when learning OpenFOAM.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-learn-the-workings-of-the-source-code-for-openfoam">How can I learn the workings of the source code for OpenFOAM?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ho-Ho, this may take some time!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the steps that I think they would give nice results in a reasonable
time period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Master <strong>C++ Programming</strong>: Are you a <strong>C</strong> programmer? Do you think you can
 handle programming in OpenFOAM? Well, think again, you really need to take a
course on <strong>C++</strong> because OpenFOAM heavily uses its Object Oriented features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need to completely master you field of study (what are you programming
OpenFOAM solvers/models for).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locally build The documentation (using <strong>Doxygen</strong>): It will be helpful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May be take a course, or use online resources to master the use of different
OpenFOAM classes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
