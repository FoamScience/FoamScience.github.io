<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall company or our suppliers be
liable to you or any third-party for any lost profits, lost data, costs of procurement of

<p>Subject to this Section, these Terms will remain
in full force and effect while you use the Site.  We may suspend or terminate your rights

the same.  In connection with our Site, we have adopted and implemented a policy
respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for
the termination of users of our online Site who are repeated infringers of intellectual
property rights, including copyrights.  If you believe that one of our users is, through
the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have
the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a
written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated
Copyright Agent:</p>

<ul>
    <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
    <li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been
infringed;</li>
    <li>identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and
that you request us to remove;</li>
    <li>sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;</li>
    <li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
    <li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable
material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and</li>
    <li>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been
infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material
fact in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability
for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written
notification and allegation of copyright infringement.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p>These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes,
we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us

providing us with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail
address that you have provided us is not valid our dispatch of the e-mail containing such
notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the
notice.  Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earliest of thirty (30)
calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar
days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.  These changes will be
effective immediately for new users of our Site.  Continued use of our Site following
notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement
to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your
contract with FOAM SCIENCE and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY
BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

<h3 id="applicability-of-arbitration-agreement">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</h3>
<p>All claims and disputes in
connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the FOAM SCIENCE
that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless
otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This
Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the FOAM SCIENCE, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates,
agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the
Terms.</p>

<h3 id="notice-requirement-and-informal-dispute-resolution">Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</h3>
<p>Before either
party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice
of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested
relief.  A Notice to the FOAM SCIENCE should be sent to: Algeria. After the Notice is received,
you and the FOAM SCIENCE may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and
the FOAM SCIENCE do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice
is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any
settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p>

<h3 id="arbitration-rules">Arbitration Rules.</h3>
<p>Arbitration shall be initiated through the American
Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that
offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate,
the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR
Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are
in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration
are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration
shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the
total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the
party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100
miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the
parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
settlement offer that the FOAM SCIENCE made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the
FOAM SCIENCE will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own
costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>

<h3 id="additional-rules-for-non-appearance-based-arbitration">Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</h3>
<p>If
non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by
telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be
chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any
personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
parties.</p>

<h3 id="time-limits">Time Limits.</h3>
<p>If you or the FOAM SCIENCE pursues arbitration, the
arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and
within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>

<h3 id="authority-of-arbitrator">Authority of Arbitrator.</h3>
<p>If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the FOAM SCIENCE, and the dispute will not be
consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The
arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA
Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge
in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
and the FOAM SCIENCE.</p>

<h3 id="waiver-of-jury-trial">Waiver of Jury Trial.</h3>
<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,
instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review
by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the FOAM SCIENCE in any
state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise,
YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be
resolved by a judge.</p>

<h3 id="waiver-of-class-or-consolidated-actions">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</h3>
<p>All claims and disputes
within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an
individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user
cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer
or user.</p>

<h3 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality.</h3>
<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be
strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise
required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of
law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award,
or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>

<h3 id="severability">Severability.</h3>
<p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and
the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-waive">Right to Waive.</h3>
<p>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in
this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.
Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="survival-of-agreement">Survival of Agreement.</h3>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
termination of your relationship with FOAM SCIENCE.</p>

<h3 id="small-claims-court">Small Claims Court.</h3>
<p>Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the
FOAM SCIENCE may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-equitable-relief">Emergency Equitable Relief.</h3>
<p>Anyhow the foregoing, either party may
seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the
status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="claims-not-subject-to-arbitration">Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing,
claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or
misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall
not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to
litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.</p>

<p>The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or
import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer,
directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from FOAM SCIENCE, or any products
utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p>

<p>FOAM SCIENCE is located at the address in Section 10.8. If you are a California resident,
you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer
Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at
400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>

<h3 id="electronic-communications">Electronic Communications.</h3>
<p>The communications between you and FOAM SCIENCE
use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether FOAM SCIENCE posts
notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a)
consent to receive communications from FOAM SCIENCE in an electronic form; and (b) agree that
all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that
FOAM SCIENCE provides to you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such
communications would satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing.</p>

<h3 id="entire-terms">Entire Terms.</h3>
<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you
and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The
section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of
these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms
will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so
that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your
