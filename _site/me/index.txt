***** About Me *****
A Petroleum Engineer with strong math & programming (C++ mostly) background,
who tries to accumulate knowledge in diverse fields as fast and efficient as
possible; currently looking for a job in the petroleum industry.
** Hi There! I'm Fadeli Mohammed Elwardi **
An "effective" programmer in C++, likes to use Python as a scripting language
but knows Bash, Lisp and Java (I chose not to dive into .Net languages but I
worked with F# also) who develops software for the Open Source Scientific
Community (Targeting Unix systems mainly), which requires decent teamwork and
communication skills and a sufficient knowledge of scientific paper &
presentation publishing systems (Latex in my case).

***** Have any projects in mind? *****
Have any Open Source Project you think I should be involved in?
Want to work on (Cpp-Or-Python Reservoir/Petroleum-related) projects together?
Or do you want to hire someone to assist you in your CFD projects?
