I can't really think of a polished introduction to such a post, so,
* This post lists some eye-catching simulations.
* The goal is to motivate and inspire new OpenFOAM users.
* This is not an ordered list, OK!
* That's it, you can start watching the videos
<!--more-->

> I will try to keep this list of great CFD simulations updated.

## A simplified OpenFOAM 2D model for a bullet

This short video shows the results of simulating a **9mm bullet** in a 2D domain
at a mach number of `1.6` using OpenFOAM (More precisely, those are Mach, pressure, velocity and
shock wave fields).

The simulation was conducted by **GDTech Belgium** and was published around the
end of 2014.

## Shock-waves hitting helium bubbles

Continuing in the same niche, but with better visualization, **Physics Central**
published a YouTube video: "Mach 3 Bubble Shockwaves" featuring the results of
intense simulations of a Mach 3 shock-wave hitting a helium bubble.

## CFD simulation of a planing hull in OpenFOAM

This half-a-minute long animation visualizes the results obtained from an OpenFOAM simulation
 of a planing hull by **TotalSimltd**:

## The Cobra Aircraft CFD Simulations 

Regardless of whether you want to watch Aircraft simulations or not, the next
video gives a great insight on how proper visualization is done!!

## Is it appropriate to compare ANSYS/Fluent and OpenFOAM this way?

Eager to watch a comparison between OpenFOAM's and Fluent's performances?

{% include youtube.html id="OBae-GV9KEA" %}

Well, OpenFOAM always has the upper hand when it comes to being `open source`!

## Bathroom Toilet CFD Simulation using OpenFOAM 

I wasn't sure if CFD engineers could pull something so serious -until I watched this video-, but **Clemens Lischka** 
did it and published the results 2 years ago!

## CFDSupport's Transient sports car simulation

This kind of simulations could take forever to finish if the engineer gets
really serious about it:
