## About [FOAM Science](https://foamscience.github.io)

This website aims to be a place for CFD people (especially OpenFOAM users, or anyone who is
willing to become one) 
to learn unique tricks, to check for new information and to discuss some CFD-related
subjects.

To achieve this goal, this website offers multiple facilities:
- [Tiny OpenFOAM Simulations](https://foamscience.github.io/simulations): 
  These are some computationally inexpensive tutorial-like simulations (originally
  meant to serve as exercises in my new OpenFOAM book, yet to be released).
- [Very Blog-like articles](https://foamscience.github.io) with minimal technical
  content.
- Some post series may treat OpenFOAM-related subjects separately, if I see there
  is a need to do so. 

## About the authors here at [FOAM Science](https://foamscience.github.io)

Up until now, only one author, *F.M. Elwardi* actively maintains this website,
writes new blog posts, and creates new CFD simulation tutorials.

He's a master student at [M'hamed Bougerra University](http://univ-boumerdes.dz),
 Boumerdes - Algeria, studying
Petroleum Production Engineering. You might be interested in knowing that he has
won Mathematical (Algerian) Olympiads while he was going to high school few years
back (Check this [link](https://www.math.purdue.edu/pow/spring2015/pdf/solution9.pdf)
if you feel like doing so).

He's currently writing an e-book on basic-to-intermediate OpenFOAM usage (Not decided
on a title yet), which is planned for release in September 2018.
