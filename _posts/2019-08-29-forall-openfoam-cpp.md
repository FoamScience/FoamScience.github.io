Because of the frequent use of range-like loops in OpenFOAM (In official code base, forks, and
any independent work for that matter), the nice developers provided a "shortcut" to loop through
all elements of a list; any list. This post tries to take a way the popular misuse of this shortcut:
Believe it or not, people abuse the `forAll` macro in every which way.

## The `forAll` macro and its "friends"

First of all, we all know that `forAll` is not part of C++, so it is a user-defined macro. 
Assuming a recent fork/version of OpenFOAM is sourced, the definition
of this macro and similar ones can be found by running the folllwoing shell commands:

```bash
cd $FOAM_SRC/$WM_PROJECT
grep -r . -e "define.*forAll"
```

The previous command reveals that there are at least four (4, `foam-extend` has some more) 
defined macros to loop through "collections":

1. The good old `forAll` and its reversed-looping version `forAllReverse`.
2. A `forAllIter` macro specialized in iterating over a Container using an "iterator" and a const-version of it.

Yep, browsing source code is extremely useful (These macros are defined in `UList.h`).

People need to understand that `forAll(list, i)` is "just" a shortcut to `for (int i=0; i<(list).size(); i++)`.
Although `i` is actually a `Foam::label` in standard OF versions. Strictly speaking; the macro just "works"
on any container that has a `size()` member method (Think of it as a vector of a known size - at construction
time). Such containers will probably (publicly) inherit from the `UList` 
(The most lightweight-efficient base class I know of).

Let's examine a very simple example of constructing a `scalarList` (a `List<scalar>`, publicly
inheriting from `UList<scalar>`).

```cpp
#include "fvCFD.H"

// * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * //

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{   
    // Create a list of some scalars
    scalarList someScalars(10, 0);

    // Perfectly fine use of forAll
    forAll(scalarList, sc)
    {
        scalarList[sc] = doSomeCalculations(sc);
    };

    Info<< "End\n" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

But this may be misleading; what if someone uses the macro to loop over a "different" type of containers,
say a `dictionary`? Is `forAll` suitable for such tasks?

{% include ad2.html %}

The answer is in the previous example actually: Common use of `forAll` requires the list object to 
- Have a `size()` method and
- Be _efficiently_ indexable with some method/operator (`operator[]` in this case), otherwise, 
  there is no benefit in looping through some collection if you can't access its elements!!

So, if `dictionary` objects verify these requirements; we're golden.

In fact, The `DictionaryBase` Template class publicly inherits from the (Link) List Type it is templated on.
It's easy to follow the inheritance diagram of the most commonly used class 
[dictionary](https://cpp.openfoam.org/v7/classFoam_1_1dictionary.html) to see that there is no `size()` method
defined anywhere. Also, how would one refer to an entry as `dictionary[i]` ??

It should be obvious now that `forAll` is not the right macro to use in this case. That's where the second family
of macros kicks in: Instead of using a (possibly more efficient) predefined-size containers, some situations
require the use of "more dynamic" ones which only hold "pointers" to their begin/end positions. An iterator
is then used to go back and forth between these positions.

A nice usage of this macro can be found at line 175 of [solution.C](https://cpp.openfoam.org/v7/solution_8C_source.html)
file so newer versions of OpenFOAM would understand older specification of `fvSolution.solver`.

The const-iter version of `forAllIter` is also used to read entries of a `dictionary` into a `HashTable` ... you can
find an example at line 146 of [HashPtrTableIO.C](https://cpp.openfoam.org/v7/HashPtrTableIO_8C_source.html).

## A word on `UList` in OpenFOAM

As far as I can tell, this class is just "well written" - "well thought through". Its purpose is 
to provide an efficient base class for "Sub-Lists". A quick look on 
[the list of classes](https://cpp.openfoam.org/v7/classFoam_1_1UList.html#details) 
that directly inherit from it shows how important `UList` is.

{% include ad3.html %}

By the way, the class also holds a random access iterator; so it can be used with `forAllIter`:
We use an object (usually called `iter`) to "point" to a list item each time we iterate. The
list item itself is accessed by dereferencing the pointer (`*iter`).

I'm not aware of a way to get the "index" of an element in a List; It would be inefficient!
So I never bothered to search for one. Another thing I should point out is that `std::distance`
probably won't work without some serious Type Casting :). It's (was?) dangerous anyway, and I 
don't know if a similar function is available for OpenFOAM iterators).

In fact, the use of `std::distance` takes away one the most important features of iterator-based
loops: The ability to loop through a container where either `.begin()` or `.end()` is not
reachable from the other (possibly by incrementing `iter`) as it results in "undefined behavior".

## A word on `dictionary` in OpenFOAM

This class a good example of a lot of things. "An iterator-based container" as I introduced it in 
this post is just the tip of the iceberg. The reason I chose it for this post is that most 
OpenFOAM _users_ consider a dictionary to be a "list" which is not entirely true. The similarity 
of, for example, getting some IDs (0, 1, 2, 3 ... ) for mesh patches from the `boundary` files 
doesn't mean a dictionary is indexable (I'm talking about "old-fashion" indexing here).
